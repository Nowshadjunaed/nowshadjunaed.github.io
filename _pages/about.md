I am a recent graduate from the Computer Science and Engineering department at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. I am confident in my ability to develop efficient and effective technical solutions to various challenges. I consider myself very fortunate to have been supervised by <a href="https://ruhulsbu.github.io/" style="text-decoration:none;">Professor Ruhul Amin</a> during my undergraduate thesis, which focused on Natural Language Processing. As a machine learning enthusiast, I am eager to continue developing my skills and making meaningful contributions to the field. Additionally, I had the privilege of organizing the <a href="https://github.com/blp-workshop/blp_task1" style="text-decoration:none;">Violence Inciting Text Detection   (VITD)</a> shared task, endorsed by the first <a href="https://blp-workshop.github.io/" style="text-decoration:none;">Bangla Language Processing (BLP)</a> workshop at EMNLP 2023, where 88 individuals, including both undergraduate and graduate students, participated.

**Currently, looking for PhD opportunities in CS for Fall â€˜25.**
