## Shopaholic
Shopaholic is an E-Commerce site. We developed this during our 7th semeseter of undergrad for the web development course using Node.js and React integrating three APIs: E-Commerce, Bank, and Supplier APIs. This platform allows users to browse products, make purchases, and track their orders. Here, we implemented a transaction flow where users make payments, the E-Commerce pays the supplier, and the supplier delivers products to the shipping address.

This project can simulate six different types of dynamic programming based problems e.g., 0-1Knapsack, Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication, Edit Distance.
